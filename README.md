## 💡 Why This Tool?

Most AI watermark removers use **generative AI inpainting**, which hallucinates missing pixels and blurs the background.

Google Gemini embeds watermarks using **transparent alpha blending**. Because the underlying pixels are still present beneath the transparency, **Gemini Watermark Remover** uses exact mathematical unblending to subtract the watermark mask pixel-by-pixel, restoring **100% of your original image & video clarity** with zero quality loss.

$$\text{Original} = \frac{\text{Watermarked} - (\text{Logo} \times \alpha)}{1 - \alpha}$$
